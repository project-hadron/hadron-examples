Project Hadron Examples
#######################

Introduction
============

Project Hadron has been built to bridge the gap between data scientists and data engineers. More specifically
between machine learning business outcomes and the final product.  It translates the work of data scientists
into meaningful, production ready solutions that can be easily managed by product engineers.

The purpose of this project is to hold example code that aligns to the Project Hadron documentation as well
as extra examples of its use. The majority of the examples are written using Juypter Notebook but can also
be used in an IDE.

Getting Started
===============

These examples require the ``discovery-transition-ds`` package to be installed, along with Jupyter or the
IDE of choice.

Package Installation
--------------------
The best way to install the component packages is directly from the Python Package Index repository using pip.

The component package is ``discovery-transition-ds`` and pip installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install discovery-transition-ds

if you want to upgrade your current version then using pip install upgrade with:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install -U discovery-transition-ds

This will also install or update dependent third party packages. The dependencies are
limited to python and related Data Science tooling such as pandas, numpy, scipy,
scikit-learn and visual packages matplotlib and seaborn, and thus have a limited
footprint and non-disruptive in a machine learning environment.

Get the Example Code
--------------------

``hadron-examples`` is actively developed on GitHub, where the code is
`always available <https://github.com/project-hadron/hadron-examples>`_.

You can clone the public repository with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:project-hadron/hadron-examples.git
